# `e` — Minimalist Terminal Text Editor

A performant, minimalist, intuitive text editor in Rust.

## Design Constraints

- Rust 2024 edition
- 3 dependencies only: `termion`, `regex-lite`, `libc` — do not add crates without good reason
- Single-file editing — no tabs, no file browser, no split panes
- macOS and Linux only (no Windows)
- Indent: 2 spaces for all files except `.c`, `.h`, `.go`, `Makefile` which use tabs
- Tabs display as 2 spaces

## Architecture

Ownership chain: `main.rs` → `Editor` → `Document` → `GapBuffer`

```
src/
  main.rs            arg parsing (single file only), file safety checks (binary, >5MB), file locking, piped stdin detection, enter raw mode
  editor.rs          Editor struct: all state, channel-based event loop, action dispatch
  buffer.rs          GapBuffer (Vec<u8> with gap) + lazy line-start index cache
  document.rs        wraps GapBuffer + UndoStack + dirty flag + filename
  selection.rs       Pos (line, col), Selection (anchor+cursor), word/line boundary helpers
  operation.rs       Operation enum (Insert/Delete), OperationGroup, UndoStack with grouping
  view.rs            Viewport: scroll offsets (scroll_line + scroll_wrap for soft-wrap), cursor-to-screen mapping, wrapped_rows helper
  render.rs          ANSI rendering: gutter, line content, tab pipes, syntax/selection/find highlighting, status bar, completions
  keybind.rs         EditorAction enum, KeybindingTable with defaults, INI config loader
  command.rs         CommandRegistry: HashMap<String, CommandFn>, built-in commands
  command_buffer.rs  Modal mini-editor for command palette, find, goto, save-as prompt, sudo password; tab completion; paste support (newlines stripped)
  clipboard.rs       Platform-detected clipboard: pbcopy/wl-copy/xclip/xsel/internal fallback
  file_io.rs         Read/write files, CRLF→LF normalization, binary detection, trailing whitespace strip, file locking, persistent undo history (single binary file ~/.config/e/undo.bin), cursor position persistence (~/.config/e/cursor.bin)
  language.rs        Language detection by file extension (~45 languages), comment syntax lookup
  signal.rs          SIGWINCH handler via libc::sigaction + AtomicBool polling
  highlight.rs       Syntax highlighting: byte-by-byte highlighter, HlType/HlState types, per-language rules (16 languages), dedicated JSON/YAML/Markdown/INI highlighters, semver detection, bracket matching, operator highlighting
```

## Key Data Structures

- **GapBuffer** (`buffer.rs`): `Vec<u8>` with `gap_start`/`gap_end`. Lazy `line_starts` cache (byte offsets of each line start, rebuilt on access after edits). All text stored as UTF-8 bytes.
- **Document** (`document.rs`): Owns `GapBuffer` + `UndoStack` + `dirty: bool` + `filename: Option<String>`. All mutations (`insert`, `delete_range`) record undo operations.
- **Pos** (`selection.rs`): `{ line: usize, col: usize }` — 0-indexed, col is character index not byte offset. Implements `Ord`.
- **Selection** (`selection.rs`): `{ anchor: Pos, cursor: Pos }`. `anchor == cursor` means no selection. `ordered()` returns `(start, end)`.
- **UndoStack** (`operation.rs`): Groups operations automatically by: kind change (insert vs delete), word boundary (space/newline), time gap (>1s), cursor jump, or explicit `seal()`. `seal()` immediately flushes the current group for atomic undo of paste/comment operations. `begin_group()`/`end_group()` force all enclosed operations into a single undo step (used by indent/dedent/comment toggle on selections). `stacks()`/`restore()` enable serialization for persistent undo. All histories stored in a single binary file `~/.config/e/undo.bin` with length-prefixed entries and mtime validation — stale history (file modified externally) is silently discarded.
- **Editor** (`editor.rs`): Owns everything. Event loop uses `mpsc` channels — background thread for stdin (or `/dev/tty` when stdin is piped). SIGWINCH polled via atomic flag on 500ms timeout. Main thread does `recv_timeout(500ms)` for status message expiry.

## Event Loop

Channel-based (`std::sync::mpsc`). No async runtime.

1. Background thread: reads `stdin.events()` via termion (or `/dev/tty` when stdin was piped) → sends `EditorEvent::Term(Event)`. Detects bracketed paste markers (`\x1b[200~`/`\x1b[201~`) and buffers pasted text into a single `EditorEvent::Paste(String)` for atomic undo.
2. Main thread: `recv_timeout(500ms)` — dispatches events, polls SIGWINCH atomic flag, expires status messages, redraws

## Rendering

All output buffered to a `Vec<u8>`, written to terminal in a single `write_all` per frame. Synchronized output protocol (`\x1b[?2026h`/`\x1b[?2026l`) wraps each frame so supporting terminals (kitty, iTerm2, WezTerm, ghostty, foot) hold rendering until complete; unsupporting terminals ignore the sequences. Lines are overwritten in-place with `\x1b[K` (erase to end of line) after content rather than `\x1b[2K` (erase entire line) before, eliminating clear-then-draw flicker. Scroll at document boundaries short-circuits (no redraw). **Soft-wrap**: long lines wrap at the right edge of the viewport (no horizontal scrolling). A logical line occupying `ceil(display_width / text_cols)` screen rows is rendered as multiple chunks. Line numbers appear only on the first wrapped row; continuation rows get blank gutters. The viewport tracks `(scroll_line, scroll_wrap)` — both which logical line and which wrapped sub-row of that line is at the top of the screen. Cursor screen position uses `col % text_cols` for the column and counts wrapped rows from the scroll position for the row. Mouse clicks walk from the scroll position through wrapped rows to map screen coordinates to buffer positions. Syntax highlighting: per-line HlState cached across frames (keyed by GapBuffer version counter); cache reused during scrolling (zero recomputation), recomputed on edits; per-char HlType mapped from byte highlights; ANSI colors emitted with minimal escape changes on the fast path. Selection/find highlights override syntax colors. Bracket matching: when cursor is on a bracket `()[]{}`, the matching bracket is highlighted with magenta background/black text. Status bar (reverse video) on second-to-last row shows `filename* [Language]` on the left and `e vVERSION` on the right (version from `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`). Command buffer on last row when active with yellow background/black text and blinking cursor. Tab completions render above the status bar. Selection rendered as reverse video, find matches as yellow background (current match green). Line numbers in dim text (current line number has white background); no separator. Tabs display as dark grey `|` pipe followed by space. Trailing whitespace highlighted with red background on lines that have non-whitespace content. Cursor hidden during find navigation mode and when selection is active.

## Keybindings

Configurable via `~/.config/e/keybindings.ini`. Format: `ctrl+key = action`.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `^s` | Save |
| `^q` | Quit (confirms if dirty) |
| `^z` | Undo |
| `^y` | Redo |
| `^a` | Select all |
| `^c` | Copy |
| `^x` | Cut |
| `^v` | Paste |
| `^f` | Find (regex, smart-case, prefills from selection); jumps to first match as you type; Enter → browse with up/down, Esc exits |
| `^p` | Command palette |
| `^l` | Goto line |
| `^k` | Kill line |
| `^t` | Goto top |
| `^g` | Goto end |
| `^d` | Toggle comment |
| `^r` | Toggle ruler |
| `^h` | Ctrl+Backspace (delete word) |
| `^j` | Duplicate line |
| `^w` | Select word at cursor |
| `Tab` | Indent selected lines (or insert tab/spaces) |
| `Shift+Tab` | Dedent line(s) |
| `Delete` | Forward delete (non-configurable) |
| `Left/Right` | Move cursor; snaps to 2-space indent stops in leading whitespace |
| `Shift+Arrows` | Extend selection (left/right also snap to indent stops) |
| `Ctrl+Left` | Move cursor to previous word boundary |
| `Ctrl+Right` | Move cursor to next word boundary |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Up` | Select from cursor to start of file |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Down` | Select from cursor to end of file |
| `Esc` / `^q` | Cancel command bar / clear selection / find highlights |

Mouse: click to place cursor, drag to select, double-click selects word (`is_word_char`: alphanumeric + underscore), triple-click selects line, scroll wheel scrolls.

## Commands

Entered via `^p` command palette. Available commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `save [filename]` | Save current file, or save-as if filename given |
| `quit` / `q` | Quit |
| `goto <line>` | Jump to line number |
| `ruler` | Toggle line number ruler |
| `find <pattern>` | Find pattern (regex, smart-case); same as `^f` submit |
| `replaceall <pattern> <replacement>` | Replace all matches (in selection if active, else whole file) |
| `comment [on\|off]` | Toggle line comments (language-aware); `on` forces comment, `off` forces uncomment |
| `selectall` | Select all text in the buffer |
| `trim` | Strip trailing whitespace from all lines |

All commands that take arguments support single-quoted (`'arg with spaces'`) and double-quoted (`"arg"`) tokens. Unquoted arguments are split on whitespace.

## Building

- `cargo build` — debug build
- `just release` — optimized release build (~313KB), requires nightly + rust-src
- `just install` — release build + copy to `/usr/local/bin/e`

## Testing

- Run tests: `cargo clippy && cargo test`
- Coverage: `cargo tarpaulin`
- Philosophy: prefer integration-style scenario tests over tiny unit tests — each test exercises a workflow or scenario covering multiple methods
- All modules have inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
- Test helper pattern for editor.rs: `ed("text")` / `ed_named("text", "file.rs")` creates an 80x24 Editor with internal-only clipboard, no disk I/O, default keybindings
- Use `std::env::temp_dir()` for any tests that need file I/O — clean up with `remove_dir_all`

## Development Guidelines

- Run `cargo clippy && cargo test` before every commit — zero warnings, all tests pass
- Prefer `&self` over `&mut self` for read-only operations (the line cache uses interior mutability via `Option<Vec<usize>>`)
- Minimize heap allocations in hot paths (render loop, cursor movement)
- No `unwrap()` on user-facing I/O — propagate errors or show in status bar
- Keep the dependency count at 3 — solve problems with std
- Tests should be self-contained with no external file dependencies (use `std::env::temp_dir()` for integration tests)
- When adding new keybindings, update `KeybindingTable::with_defaults()` in `keybind.rs`, `parse_action()` match arm, and `~/.config/e/keybindings.ini`
